<p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had no name of her own.  She was only identified by the riding hood her grandmother made for<br>
    her, so everyone called her ‘Little Red Riding Hood’, hereafter known as ‘LRRH’, because I don’t want to type that <em>every time</em> I <br>
    refer to the <strong>main character</strong>.<br>
    So one day, LRRH’s mother told her to take some food to her grandmother who lived in the woods, because she was sick.<br>
    “It’s a pretty easy way,” said her mother.  “Just follow the path, don’t leave the path, and don’t talk to strangers.  Remember, path<br>
    <strong>good</strong>, strangers <strong>bad</strong>.”<br>
    So LRRH went out into the woods all by herself, skipping and humming.  As she was so engaged, a wolf came out of the trees, and said <br>
    “Hello, Little Red Riding Hood, where are you going?”<br>
    Unphased by the wolf that both spoke human and knew her title, LRRH replied, “I’m taking food to my poor sick grandmother,” thus<br>
    breaking one of the <em>only two</em> rules her mother had set.<br>
    “Oh, how wonderful,” said the wolf.  “Do you think she would like some flowers as well?”<br>
    “What a wonderful idea!” LRRH exclaimed, and stepped right off the path to gather flowers, going deeper and deeper into the woods to <br>
    get prettier ones, absolutely smashing the other of the <em> TWO </em> rules her mother gave her.<br>
    The wolf then ran to her grandmother’s house, and knocked on the door, pretending to be LRRH.  Whether everyone in this story is stupid<br>
    or this wolf is the best actor to ever exist is up to interpretation, because Grandmother lets him in, and he eats her.<br>
    A while later, LRRH remembers what she was doing, somehow gets back to the path despite wandering all over the woods looking for flowers<br>
    (maybe this was why her mother wasn’t that concerned about letting her go; she obviously had an amazing sense of direction, though that <br>
    calls into question why the path was necessary in the first place), and continues on to her grandmother’s house.<br>
    When she gets there, she knocks on the door, and is told to come in by what apparently sounds like her grandmother.  She sees her<br>
    ‘grandmother’ on the bed, and makes several famous comments about her appearance.  Grandmother is then revealed to be, get this, <em>the <br>
        wolf</em>.  Shocking, right?  The wolf jumps out of the bed, and LRRH only has time to scream before the wolf eats her.  Then the wolf<br>
    goes to sleep.<br>
    But it turns out a scream was all LRRH needed, because a guy with an ax was passing by and heard (sources vary on whether he was a woodcutter<br>
    or a huntsman).  Ax guy comes into Grandmother’s cottage, and, showing himself to somehow be one of the smartest people in this story, <br>
    deduces what happened, and cuts the wolf’s stomach open.  Not only does this <em> not wake or kill the wolf</em>, but both LRRH and<br>
    Grandmother tumble out <em>unharmed</em>.<br>
    Then, to get back at the wolf, they fill his stomach with rocks, and sew it back up.<br>
    When the wolf eventually wakes up, he has a stomach ache, and goes to drink from a stream, and drowns in it, because he was full of rocks.<br>
