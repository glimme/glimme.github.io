<p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who had no name of her own.  She was only identified by the riding hood her grandmother made for<br>
    her, so everyone called her ‘Little Red Riding Hood’, hereafter known as ‘LRRH’, because I don’t want to type that <em>every time</em> I <br>
    refer to the <strong>main character</strong>.<br>
    So one day, LRRH’s mother told her to take some food to her grandmother who lived in the woods, because she was sick.<br>
    “It’s a pretty easy way,” said her mother.  “Just follow the path, don’t leave the path, and don’t talk to strangers.  Remember, path<br>
    <strong>good</strong>, strangers <strong>bad</strong>.”<br>
