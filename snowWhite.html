<p>Okay, so a long, long time ago (inagalaxyfaraway no, sorry), there was a king and queen with no kids.  This made the queen sad, so she<br>
    went outside to sew, in the dead of winter, because what else would you do?  So she was sitting there with her nice ebony sewing hoop<br>
    thing (frame?), in the snow, when she pricked herself with the needle, and a drop of blood fell on the snow.  Instead of being in pain,<br>
    she thought that color combination looked really pretty, and wished for a child ‘as dark as ebony, as white as snow, and as red as blood.’<br>
    Then her wish came true, because this is a fairytale, and you have to be careful what you wish for.  Fairies are tricky.  Then she died,<br>
    I think in childbirth, because, again, fairytale.<br>
    This made the king very sad, so he got married to the most beautiful woman in the land.  He is now irrelevant.<br>
    Now, the woman he married was now a step-mother, as well as a queen.  By fairytale law, she was now the most evil being in the land.  And<br>
    she was very vain.  She looked good, knew it, and made damn sure everyone else knew it.  She had this huge mirror in her room, and <em>every<br>
        day</em> she went up to this mirror and asked it for validation.  And every day it assured her she was the most beautiful.<br>
    Until one day (because who wants a story about the status quo <strong>not</strong> breaking down), the mirror replied that Snow White had<br>
    become more beautiful than her overnight, somehow.<br>
