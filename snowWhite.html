<p>Once upon a time, there was a king and queen with no kids.  This made the queen sad, so she<br>
    went outside to sew, in the dead of winter, because what else would you do?  So she was sitting there with her nice ebony sewing hoop<br>
    thing (frame?), in the snow, when she pricked herself with the needle, and a drop of blood fell on the snow.  Instead of being in pain,<br>
    she thought that color combination looked really pretty, and wished for a child ‘as dark as ebony, as white as snow, and as red as blood.’<br>
    Then her wish came true, because this is a fairytale, and you have to be careful what you wish for.  Fairies are tricky.  Then she died,<br>
    I think in childbirth, because, again, fairytale.<br>
    This made the king very sad, so he got married to the most beautiful woman in the land.  He is now irrelevant.<br>
    Now, the woman he married was now a step-mother, as well as a queen.  By fairytale law, she was now the most evil being in the land.  And<br>
    she was very vain.  She looked good, knew it, and made damn sure everyone else knew it.  She had this huge mirror in her room, and <em>every<br>
        day</em> she went up to this mirror and asked it for validation.  And every day it assured her she was the most beautiful.<br>
    Until one day (because who wants a story about the status quo <strong>not</strong> breaking down), the mirror replied that Snow White had<br>
    become more beautiful than her overnight, somehow.<br>
    This threw the queen into a jealous rage, so she called a huntsman to see her, and demanded he take Snow White into the woods and kill<br>
    her, then <em>cut out her heart</em> so the queen could <em>cook and eat it.</em>  This lady had problems.<br>
    The huntsman was (understandably) made uncomfortable by this order, but was pretty loyal, so he took Snow White into the woods, and told<br>
    her he had to kill her.  She, upset by this for some reason, started crying and begging him not to kill her.  And she was so sad and <br>
    pretty, the huntsman let her go, because beauty is power, kids.<br>
    So Snow White ran off into the woods, and the huntsman found an animal (sources vary on what animal), killed it, and brought its heart <br>
    back to the queen.  The queen then devoured it raw, to consume Snow White’s beauty-power, and apparently unable to tell the difference <br>
    between the heart of an animal and the heart of a 14-year-old girl (that’s right, Snow White is canonically <em>14 years old</em>).<br>
    So Snow White was running through the woods, terrified and sad, when she came across a cabin in the woods.  Because neither horror movies<br>
    nor manners had been invented yet, she entered the cabin, ate the food she found, and slept on the beds (were she and Goldilocks related?).<br>
    A while later,
