<p>Once upon a time, there was a king and queen with no kids.  This made the queen sad, so she went outside to sew, in the dead of winter,<br>
    because what else would you do?  So she was sitting there with her nice ebony sewing hoop thing (frame?), in the snow, when she pricked<br>
    herself with the needle, and a drop of blood fell on the snow.  Instead of being in pain, she thought that color combination looked really<br>
    pretty, and wished for a child ‘as dark as ebony, as white as snow, and as red as blood.’  Then her wish came true, because this is a<br>
    fairytale, and you have to be careful what you wish for.  Fairies are tricky.  Then she died, I think in childbirth, because, again,<br>
    fairytale.<br>
    This made the king very sad, so he got married to the most beautiful woman in the land.  He is now irrelevant.  He might have died, <br>
    I'm not sure.  I think so, that's what usually happens.  <br>
    Now, the woman he married was now a step-mother, as well as a queen.  By fairytale law, she was now the most evil being in the land.  And<br>
    she was very vain.  She looked good, knew it, and made damn sure everyone else knew it.  She had this huge mirror in her room, and <em>every<br>
        day</em> she went up to this mirror and asked it for validation.  And every day it assured her she was the most beautiful.<br>
    Until one day (because who wants a story about the status quo <strong>not</strong> breaking down), the mirror replied that Snow White had<br>
    become more beautiful than her overnight, somehow.<br>
    This threw the queen into a jealous rage, so she called a huntsman to see her, and demanded he take Snow White into the woods and kill<br>
    her, then <em>cut out her heart</em> so the queen could <em>cook and eat it.</em><br>
    The huntsman was (understandably) made uncomfortable by this order, but was pretty loyal, so he took Snow White into the woods, and told<br>
    her he had to kill her.  She, upset by this for some reason, started crying and begging him not to kill her.  And she was so sad and <br>
    pretty, the huntsman let her go, because beauty is power, kids.<br>
    So Snow White ran off into the woods, and the huntsman found an animal (sources vary on what animal), killed it, and brought its heart <br>
    back to the queen.  The queen then devoured it raw, to consume Snow White’s beauty-power, and apparently unable to tell the difference <br>
    between the heart of an animal and the heart of a 14-year-old girl (that’s right, Snow White is canonically <em>14 years old</em>).<br>
    So Snow White was running through the woods, terrified and sad, when she came across a cabin in the woods.  Because neither horror movies<br>
    nor manners had been invented yet, she entered the cabin, ate the food she found, and slept on the beds (were she and Goldilocks related?).<br>
    A while later, the twelve dwarves who own this house come home, and are dismayed to find their food eaten.  Then they go upstairs and find a <br>
    girl sleeping in their beds.  They proceed to stare at her until she wakes up, which is kind-of creepy, but also kind-of understandable,<br>
    because that is a weird thing to find, especially if you live in the middle of the woods.<br>
    Eventually, Snow White wakes up, and is also understandably a little freaked out by the twelve men watching her sleep.  Everyone panics for<br>
    a few seconds, then Snow White apologises for her breaking and entering, and eating their food, and stealing their beds.  The dwarves are pretty<br>
    cool about this, and say she can stay with them, probably figuring that a young girl breaking into a cabin in the middle of nowhere to eat and<br>
    sleep is not likely to have a place to go back to.<br>
    So Snow White spends some time taking care of the dwarves and their house, weirdly good at household chores despite being a princess who has never<br>
    left the castle before.<br>
    Meanwhile, the queen is super happy, thinking her rival to title of most beautiful is dead and/or fueling her own beauty via the creepy heart<br>
    eating.  Until, of course, the next day, when she goes back to her mirror, and finds out Snow White is still at large.  This makes her so pissed,<br>
    she does witchcraft, and turns herself into an old lady, and poisons a comb.  She then travels to the dwarves cabin, probably getting the location<br>
    from more witchcraft or something.  She goes around near the cabin shouting about the pretty things she hat for sale, and Snow White comes out to see.<br>
    The ‘old woman’ complements her on her beauty, and offers her the poisoned comb.  Snow White accepts the comb, and the moment it touches her head, she<br>
    falls down.  The queen leaves cackling, and the dwarves come home to find Snow White basically dead.  They find the comb in her hair, and pull it out<br>
    and give her wine, for some reason.<br>
    When Snow White tells them what happens, they explain the concept of ‘stranger danger’ to her, and tell her not to let any more strangers in.<br>
    The next time the queen finds out Snow White is alive, she curses some stays, and applies the same strategy.  This time, Snow White doesn’t let her <br>
    in, but still lets tie the stays around her, basically suffocating her.  The dwarves come home, and find Snow White basically dead on the floor <br>
    again, and cut her stays.  They then try to explain ‘stranger danger’ again, and tell her not to go outside to talk to strangers either.<br>
    This time, the queen poisons an apple, and some of the lessons the dwarves have been giving Snow White seem to have stuck, because this time she<br>
    doesn’t immediately take the free stuff.  But the queen is still smarter than her, and only poisoned half of the apple.  Snow White still isn’t that <br>
    smart, because the apple is half red, half white, and she lets the ‘old woman’ decide who will eat which half, but she gets some points for trying. <br>
    She still chokes on her first bite, however.<br>
    This time, when the dwarves come home, they can’t find anything wrong with Snow White, and conclude she must be really dead this time.  So they make<br>
    her a glass coffin, because she’s still really pretty, and mourn her.<br>
    After some time, a prince is riding through the forest, and finds this glass coffin, with a pretty girl inside.  He instantly falls in love with this<br>
    beautiful <em>dead stranger</em>, and decides to <em> take her with him</em>.  Then the dwarves come, and tell him this is their dead friend, and they<br>
    won’t part with her.  The prince cries, and swears he will die if he cannot have this corpse.  Eventually, he promises they can come too, and continue<br>
    watching over her.<br>
    The prince tells his attendants to carry the coffin with them to the palace.  As they are walking, one trips, and jostles the coffin in such a way that<br>
    the bite of apple flies out of Snow White’s throat, and she is immediately all better, despite having suffocated a while ago.  She sits up, justifiably<br>
    confused by being in a coffin, and is probably more confused when this guy she’s never met immediately proposes to her.  But she accepts anyway, because<br>
    <strong>fairytales</strong>!<br>
    Later (that’s right, this ain’t over yet), the queen gets an invitation to this wedding, although she doesn’t know who it’s for.  So she gets all dressed<br>
    up, and then the story has two versions that I really like, and will share with you.<br>
    <strong>Version 1</strong><br>
    After getting dressed, the queen goes to her mirror, and asks who the fairest is.  The mirror decides not to give a straight answer for once, and tells<br>
    her the bride for the wedding she is going to is fairer.  The queen throws another hissy fit, and makes a poisoned rose to give the bride.<br>
    She gets to the wedding, ready for more murdering, and sees the bride is the previously thought dead Snow White.  In her anger, she clutches the rose, <br>
    and is poisoned by the thorns and falls down dead.  Then Snow White and the prince live happily ever after.<br>
    <strong>Version 2</strong><br>
    In this version, the queen does not ask the mirror before she leaves, and once she gets to the wedding, Snow White and the prince are waiting for her. <br>
    They have people grab her, and put some iron shoes in an oven until the shoes are glowing red.  Then they put the shoes on the queen’s feet, and command<br>
    her to dance.  She hops around, screaming, because <em>literally red-hot shoes</em>, until she falls down dead.  Then Snow White and the prince live <br>
    happily ever after.<br>
