<p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived with her parents, and was happy.  But that’s not much of a fairytale, so her mother dies.<br>
    The little girl is so sad, and cries on her mother’s grave so much, a big tree grows there.<br>
    After a while, her father marries a widow, with two daughters of her own.  Then he dies.<br>
    The little girl’s new step-mother is terrible.  She makes the girl sleep in the fireplace and do all the chores, because she is jealous of her<br>
    prettiness and niceness.  This makes her very dirty and sooty, so her step-sisters start calling her Cinderella, and everyone forgot her real name.<br>
    One day, a message arrives from the palace, saying every eligible maiden is invited to a ball, because either the prince or his parents are getting <br>
    desperate.  The step-sisters are super excited, and so is the step-mother.  Cinderella is too, but her step-mother throws a bowl of seeds into the<br>
    fireplace, and tells Cinderella that she can only go if she can pick every seed out of the fireplace in a single day.<br>
    However, Cinderella was declared a Disney princess, and thus has dominion over animals.  She calls some birds to do the task for her, and they finish<br>
    within an hour or so.<br>
    When the step-mother gets back, and finds every seed in the bowl, she gets super mad, and tells Cinderella to sort the seeds, or she won’t go.  But<br>
    Cinderella summons ants to sort for her, and is again done in a few hours.<br>
    This sends the step-mother into a rage, tells Cinderella she couldn’t go anyway because she doesn’t have a nice enough dress, and takes her daughters<br>
    to the ball.<br>
    But Cinderella is some sort of necromancer, and asks the tree growing on her mother’s grave for help, and is magically given the most beautiful outfit.<br>
    She goes to the ball, and the prince immediately falls for her.  But she ditches him to go back to her miserable life of servitude, for some reason. <br>
    Possibly because she doesn’t know him.<br>
    The next night, there is another ball, and the same thing happens, except this time, the step-mother doesn’t even pretend Cinderella can go to the ball.<br>
    The third night, the prince coats the palace steps in tar, and one of Cinderella’s shoes gets left behind (though no one else’s do.  It’s probably fairy <br>
    tar or something).<br>
    When the prince finds this, he immediately declares he will marry the girl whose foot fits the shoe, which sounds really stupid, but actually, depending on<br>
    the version, the shoe either gets <em>enormous</em> and only goes back to normal size when Cinderella wears it, or Cinderella has impossibly tiny feet, so it<br>
    makes sense in those versions.<br>
    Either way, eventually, they get to Cinderella’s house, and the two step-sisters get to try on the shoe.  Their mother demands they cut off parts of their feet <br>
    to fit in the shoe, proving that she’s mother of the year to all children, but the guards notice the blood each time and disqualify them.  Then Cinderella comes<br>
    along and fits the shoe naturally.  She and the prince get married, and some crows drop a heavy object on the step-mother, killing her, and peck out the<br>
    step-sisters’ eyes.<br>
</p>
<p id="end">THE END.</p>
