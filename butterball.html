<p>So this story isn’t as well known, but I love it.<br>
    The ‘hero’ of this story is a little boy, who loves butter so much, he’s known only as Butterball.  One day, <br>
    Butterball’s mother sees a troll-lady coming, and tells him to hide under the table.  He does so, and when the <br>
    troll-lady knocks on the door and asks for him, his mother tells her that he’s out.  The troll-lady says she was planning<br>
    on giving him a silver knife, and Butterball pops out from under the table, to his mother’s exasperation.<br>
    The troll-lady says the knife is in the bag she’s carrying, but her back hurts (hands up if you can see where this is going),<br>
    so could Butterball crawl into the bag to get it?  He does, and she grabs the bag and hightails it out of there.<br>
    Halfway to her house, she stops to rest, and Butterball cuts the bag open with the <em>knife that was actually in the bag</em>.<br>
        He then puts a big root in the bag, to trick the troll-lady into thinking he’s still in there, and runs home.<br>
        The next day, the same thing happens, except with a silver fork instead of a knife.<br>
        The third day, it’s a spoon, and the troll-lady doesn’t stop until she gets home.<br>
        She tells her daughter to start making stew out of Butterball, and leaves for unknown reasons.  However, her daughter is <br>
        incompetent, and doesn’t even know how to boil water.  Butterball offers help, and tells her to check the temperature of <br>
        the water by sticking her head in it.  She does this immediately, and he pushes her the rest of the way in.<br>
        Eventually, the troll-lady and her husband get home, and exclaim about how good the stew looks, smells and tastes, with<br>
        Butterball providing color commentary on the actual nature of the stew.  Then he drops rocks on their heads, which kills <br>
        them, and goes home with silver, gold, and jewels he found somewhere.
