<p>So, there are a lot of places to go where you can find classic stories retold in humorous ways.  And I'm not going to pretend to
    <br>be better than them.  But I needed a final project for coding class, and I had this idea back before I knew it was so popular.
    <br>So this is my attempt to retell classic stories in a humorous way.  These are my retellings.
