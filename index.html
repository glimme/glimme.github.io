      <h3>Old stories retold</h3>
      <p>So, there are a lot of places to go where you can find classic stories retold in humorous ways.  And I'm not going to pretend to
        <br>be better than them.  but I needed a final project for coding class, and I had this idea back before I knew it was so popular.
        <br>So this is my attempt to retell classic stories in a humorous way.  These are my retellings.
